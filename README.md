A library management system oversees various sets of information, including:
● Book details comprising identifiers, title, author, edition, storage, publisher,..
● Storage information containing identifiers, block, shelf,..
● Category information with identifiers, name, keyword, language,..
● Author information including identifiers, name, address, gender, nationality,..
Several constraints must be established, such as books being associated with category, Books
being linked to storage, authors having works in the library, etc. This system empowers
librarians to execute diverse functions related to books, category, storage and authors through
the user interface.
