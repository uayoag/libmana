# How to use git
1. `git status` to check status of files (not tracked, tracked: new and modified )
2. `git add .` to add all files to **staged changes** (check on **Source control**)
3. `git commit -m"<your message>"` to commit your new version.
4. `git push origin main` to push your changes to remote repository on Github with `origin` is your remote and `main` is your branch

# Step to impl one feature:
1. Read requirements
2. Run SQL queries on Command line **PHP MY ADMIN**
3. Connect to db in server
4. Execute the queries that generated in `step 2`
5. After getting the results, fill it in to your prepared `html`
